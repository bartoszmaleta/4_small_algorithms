ProgBasic Mini Checkpoint
Ladies and gentleman, welcame to the ProgBasic mini checkpoint!

RULES
Clone this repository.
Run the tests:
python -m doctest check.py
You should see something like:

4 items had failures:
   2 of   2 in check.get_common_elements
   2 of   2 in check.get_letters_statistics
   2 of   2 in check.get_odd_elements
   2 of   2 in check.get_sum_of_all_even_elements
***Test Failed*** 8 failures.
Your task is to write all four functions in a way no output will be produced when the tests are run. That means the tests pass.

You can use your previous projects and/or various internet resources, but we kindly ask you not to use any help from other students!

You don't have to write main() function

Please commit and push changes after each completed function.

You have 60 minutes to complete.

Good luck!
